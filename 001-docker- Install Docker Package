Last week the Nautilus DevOps team met with the application development team and decided to containerize several of their applications. The DevOps team wants to do some testing per the following:
Install docker-ce and docker-compose packages on App Server 2.
Start docker service.

sshpass -p Am3ric@ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no steve@172.16.238.11
sudo su
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
systemctl start docker
