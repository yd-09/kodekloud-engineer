 We have LEMP stack configured on apps and database server in Stratos DC. Its using Nginx + php-fpm,                                                                 
 for now we have deployed a sample php page on these apps. Due to some misconfiguration the php page
 is not loading on the web server. Seems like at least two app servers are having issues. 
 Find below more details and make sure website works on LBR URL and locally on each app as well.
 
 1. Nginx is supposed to run on port 80 on all app servers.
 2. Nginx document root is /var/www/html/
 3. Test the webpage on LBR URL (use LBR button on the top bar) and locally on each app server to make 
     sure it works. It must not display any error message or nginx default page.
